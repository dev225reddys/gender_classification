# gender_classification

##Overview

The code uses the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library to train a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics. 

##Dependencies

* Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

Install missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
